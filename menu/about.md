Hi! I'm **Bijay Gurung**. I love reading, writing and learning. I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, technology in general and lifey-things (a vague term that means nothing and everything).

I'm a collector of thoughts. I catch most of them while roaming the streets of ~~Kathmandu~~ Freiburg im Breisgau. Some I mould into poems, some into ideas, essays, articles, etc, while some I just keep around. (More like: they hang around.)

This blog is a home for those thoughts-turned-into-*X* things.  
So, *X*pect randomness.

Have a great day!
