What are we coding here?  
I don't know  
There are no requirements  
No designs, no user flow.  
I wouldn't call it love though  
Because then we would be guilty of  
premature Romantization  
  
Yet  
I want to print this out in all caps  
Log it all down  
How when you say hello  
The world  
just melts away  
How when your hands are in mine  
Booleans lose their value as everything becomes true  
How if what we have here were a function  
I'd never want it to return  
Instead just leave us in the void  
Together.  
  
Now, we're gonna have arguments  
There will be a lot of bugs because  
You are not perfect, that I know  
And by God, I know I'm not  
But you know what  
That's okay  
That it doesn't work as expected  
We'll just call the bugs features  
And go over it all  
Line by line  
All the weird behaviours  
Yours and mine  
And us  
We'll fix some,  
Laugh at some  
Some we'll not correct  
Just move it to done  
Some we'll leave  
in progress.  
  
There are no ifs and elses here  
Okay maybe there are  
A lot of ifs  
Because even things  
made out of pure logic  
Have a lot of uncertainty  
And this  
This doesn't feel logical at all  
This just feels.  
  
But this much I know  
While I'm with you  
I wanna stay in the loop  
Unconditionally  
No break statement  
Let the OS complain  
That the memories we create are taking too much space  
That we are hogging too many resources  
Hugging each other.  
  
And Even when it all crashes down  
And terminates,  
this program will keep running,  
In our hearts.
