Hello, World! For the second time.

I had been thinking about creating an online home for some time. I finally got around to doing it today. I ought to do that more often: stop thinking, start taking action. 
So, ya. This is it. 

Just like when I was [starting out on Medium](https://medium.com/@bijaygurung/hello-world-tackling-the-ignition-cost-1c421556057e), I have no idea what I'll do here:

> A quick warning though: I have no idea what I shall write about, so it will probably be some random topic that manages to keep me interested long enough for me to sit down and endeavor to harp about it.

But hopefully, this'll prompt me to write/create/learn more.
